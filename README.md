# Medimist
> Simple HTML template ready to convert to WordPress Theme.

This template was inspired by the simplicity of the website design on Medium.com. Don't let the simplicity fool you because it took quite a bit of tweaking to make this a block-style template so that it can easily be converted into a Full Site Editor WordPress theme. Although it holds a high resemblance to the Medium website design, it is intentionally not an exact replica of Medium website due to personal preferences and the discovery that Medium has inconsistencies and some layouts on their site does not make optimal use of the screen space.
